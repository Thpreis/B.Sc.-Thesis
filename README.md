- **Abstract:** Building upon the framework of Kinetic Field Theory developed by Bartelmann et al.,
we calculate the cosmic two-point density-fluctuation power spectrum to first order in
perturbations for particles moving along Zel’dovich trajectories. The validity of our treat-
ment is assessed by comparing our results to those obtained from standard perturbation
theory in an analytically and numerically feasible manner. We are able to accurately
reproduce the density-fluctuation power spectrum in the linear regime of cosmic struc-
ture formation as recovered in conventional approaches. The overall behaviour found
for the non-linear density-fluctuation power spectrum qualitatively agrees with results
obtained in numerical N-body simulations.
